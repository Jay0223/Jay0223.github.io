# Los Angeles Mountains Page

This came to me as a skill test when I was applying for a web developer position. It ended up requiring more codes than I thought, so I decided to put it in my portfolio. This is a responsive page with an image carousel, no difficult stuff. But I learned how to get useful information from a psd file.

Finger crossed for job hunting~~
