            In this game, you have 10 chances to guess a four-digit number. It
            has to be four differnt digits, so the answer won't be like 6666, or
            1212. Please note the first digit could be 0.
          </p>
          <p class="info">
            You will see how good was your guess in the right panel. "xA" means
            among the four digits you guessed, x of them are correct for BOTH
            number and position. "yB" means y of the digits are ONLY correct for
            number.
          </p>
          <p class="info">
            For example, if the answer is 0239 and your guess is 1309, the
            result would be "1A2B" since you correctly guessed "9" to be fourth
            digit (1A) and you are also right that "0" and "3" are in the answer
            but not at your guessed position (2B). If you could get a "4A0B" in
            10 tries, you win the game!
          </p>
          <p class="info">
            After a few guesses, you will become more and more sure what digits
            are in the answer. Based on your guess history, with luck and your
            high IQ, you will beat the game.
          </p>
